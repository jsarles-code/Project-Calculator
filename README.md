# Project-Calculator

# Create all the buttons needed 0-9 , +,-,/, *. = , Clear 
# Create a Display Element at the top

A calculator operation will consist of a number, an operator, and another number. For example, 3 + 5. Create three variables for each of the parts of a calculator operation. Create a variable for the first number, the operator, and the second number.
Create a new function operate that takes an operator and 2 numbers and then calls one of the above functions on the numbers.
Create a basic HTML calculator with buttons for each digit, each of the above functions and an “Equals” key.
Do not worry about wiring up the JS just yet.
There should also be a display for the calculator. Go ahead and fill it with some dummy numbers so it looks correct.
Add a “clear” button.
Create the functions that populate the display when you click the number buttons. You should be storing the ‘display value’ in a variable somewhere for use in the next step.
Make the calculator work! You’ll need to store the first number and second number that are input into the calculator, utilize the operator that the user selects, and then operate() on the two numbers when the user presses the “=” key.
